2.5.

the linked lists array, an hybrid data structure,
for searches:
- is slower than an array, because inside of each index it has a list,
which is slower to searches. I directly access the letter index (z is 26, for example),
and inside of it, there are less items to do the search. but those items are in a list,
so it will iterate over all the items to find the middle index and do the binary search.

for insertions
- is faster than an array, because I directly enter in the letter index
and add the item inside the list, updating the previous and the next indexes.
