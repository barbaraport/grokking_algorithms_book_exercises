To create an multiplication table, as the questions says,
I need to iterate over each element to multiply it. 

Said that, it will take O(n^2) to complete the table creation,
because I iterate over each number, and inside of each iteration I
iterate all over again.

For example:
[1, 2, 3] -> 1*1, 1*2, 1*3, 2*1, 2*2, 2*3, 3*1, 3*2, 3*3 -> 9 times -> n items in array = 3 -> n^2 = 9
[2, 4] -> 2*2, 2*4, 4*2, 4*4, -> 4 times -> n items in array = 2 -> n^2 = 4
