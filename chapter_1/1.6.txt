1.6.

so... this one I read the answer, but I still need to process it to truly understand.

but, basically, what I initially thought was that:

I have a sorted list, so the letter A would be in the initial indexes.
I could simply check if the word starts with A,
and, for the other letters, just stop the execution.
if the letter A just doesn't exist, then I can stop the execution too.

if I had to use the binary search,
I would find the first word with A O(log2 n) and then check the next items O(n),
which would mix both types of search.
